== Requirements

Verify support for your ONTAP cluster, set up your networking, and prepare your object storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

image:diagram_cloud_tiering_s3_compat.png["An architecture image that shows the BlueXP tiering service with a connection to the Connector on your premises, the Connector with a connection to your ONTAP cluster, and a connection between the ONTAP cluster and object storage. Active data resides on the ONTAP cluster, while inactive data resides in object storage."]

NOTE: Communication between the Connector and the S3-compatible object storage server is for object storage setup only.

=== Preparing your ONTAP clusters

Your source ONTAP clusters must meet the following requirements when tiering data to S3-compatible object storage.

Supported ONTAP platforms::
You can tier data from AFF systems, or FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates or all-HDD aggregates.

Supported ONTAP version::
ONTAP 9.8 or later

Cluster networking requirements::
* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over a user-specified port to S3-compatible object storage (the port is configurable during tiering setup).
+
The source ONTAP system reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.

* An inbound connection is required from the Connector, which must reside on your premises.
+
A connection between the cluster and the BlueXP tiering service is not required.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to tier. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
When you set up data tiering, BlueXP tiering prompts you for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[LIFs^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[IPspaces^].

include::_include/tiering_supported_volumes.adoc[]

TIP: BlueXP tiering supports both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.

=== Discovering an ONTAP cluster

You need to create an on-premises ONTAP working environment before you can start tiering cold data.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster^].

=== Preparing S3-compatible object storage

S3-compatible object storage must meet the following requirements.

S3 credentials::
When you set up tiering to S3-compatible object storage, you're prompted to create an S3 bucket or to select an existing S3 bucket. You need to provide BlueXP tiering with an S3 access key and secret key. BlueXP tiering uses the keys to access your bucket.
+
These access keys must be associated with a user who has the following permissions:
+
[source,json]
"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
"s3:ListBucket",
"s3:GetObject",
"s3:PutObject",
"s3:DeleteObject",
"s3:CreateBucket"

=== Creating or switching Connectors

A Connector is required to tier data to the cloud. When tiering data to S3-compatible object storage, a Connector must be available on your premises. You'll either need to install a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides on-prem.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-install-connector-on-prem.html[Install and set up a Connector on-premises^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-manage-multiple-connectors.html#switch-between-connectors[Switch between Connectors^]

=== Preparing networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections.

.Steps

. Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to the BlueXP tiering service (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-set-up-networking-on-prem.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[see the list of endpoints^])
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to S3-compatible object storage
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF

== Tiering inactive data from your first cluster to S3-compatible object storage

After you prepare your environment, start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

.What you'll need

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[An on-premises working environment^].
* The FQDN of the S3-compatible object storage server and the port that will be used for HTTPS communications.
* An access key and secret key that has the required S3 permissions.

.Steps

. Select the on-premises ONTAP working environment.

. Select *Enable* for the Tiering service from the right panel.
+
image:screenshot_setup_tiering_onprem.png[A screenshot that shows the Tiering option that appears on the right side of the screen after you select an on-premises ONTAP working environment.]

. *Define Object Storage Name*: Enter a name for this object storage. It must be unique from any other object storage you may be using with aggregates on this cluster.

. *Select Provider*: Select *S3 Compatible* and select *Continue*.

. Complete the steps on the *Create Object Storage* pages:

.. *Server*: Enter the FQDN of the S3-compatible object storage server, the port that ONTAP should use for HTTPS communication with the server, and the access key and secret key for an account that has the required S3 permissions.

.. *Bucket*: Add a new bucket or select an existing bucket and select *Continue*.

.. *Cluster Network*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage and select *Continue*.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that BlueXP tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your S3-compatible object storage.
+
You can also set the network bandwidth available to upload inactive data to object storage by defining the "Maximum transfer rate". Select the *Limited* radio button and enter the maximum bandwidth that can be used, or select *Unlimited* to indicate that there is no limit.

. On the _Success_ page select *Continue* to set up your volumes now.

. On the _Tier Volumes_ page, select the volumes that you want to configure tiering for and select *Continue*:

+
* To select all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[""]) and select *Configure volumes*.
* To select multiple volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[""]) and select *Configure volumes*.
* To select a single volume, select the row (or image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[edit pencil icon] icon) for the volume.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_initial_volumes.png["A screenshot that shows how to select a single volume, multiple volumes, or all volumes, and the modify selected volumes button."]

. In the _Tiering Policy_ dialog, select a tiering policy, optionally adjust the cooling days for the selected volumes, and select *Apply*.
