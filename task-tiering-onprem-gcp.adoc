== Requirements

Verify support for your ONTAP cluster, set up your networking, and prepare your object storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

Active data resides on the ONTAP cluster, while inactive data resides in object storage."]

NOTE: Communication between the Connector and Google Cloud Storage is for object storage setup only.

=== Preparing your ONTAP clusters

Your ONTAP clusters must meet the following requirements when tiering data to Google Cloud Storage.

Supported ONTAP platforms::
* When using ONTAP 9.8 and later: You can tier data from AFF systems, or FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates or all-HDD aggregates.
* When using ONTAP 9.7 and earlier: You can tier data from AFF systems, or FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates.

Supported ONTAP versions::
ONTAP 9.6 or later

include::_include/tiering-admin-app-access.adoc[]

Cluster networking requirements::
* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over port 443 to Google Cloud Storage.
+
ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.
+
Although a Google Cloud Interconnect provides better performance and lower data transfer charges, it's not required between the ONTAP cluster and Google Cloud Storage. But doing so is the recommended best practice.

* An inbound connection is required from the Connector, which resides in a Google Cloud Platform VPC.
+
A connection between the cluster and the Cloud Tiering service is not required.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to tier. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
When you set up data tiering, Cloud Tiering prompts you for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[LIFs^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[IPspaces^].

include::_include/tiering_supported_volumes.adoc[]

NOTE: Cloud Tiering supports FlexGroup volumes. Setup works the same as any other volume.

=== Discovering an ONTAP cluster

You need to create an on-prem ONTAP working environment in Cloud Manager before you can start tiering cold data.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster^].

=== Creating or switching Connectors

A Connector is required to tier data to the cloud. When tiering data to Google Cloud Storage, a Connector must be available in a Google Cloud Platform VPC. You'll either need to create a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides in GCP.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-gcp.html[Deploying a Connector in GCP^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html[Switching between Connectors^]

=== Preparing networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections.

.Steps

. Ensure that the VPC where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An outbound internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service over port 443 (HTTPS)
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to Google Cloud Storage
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF

. Optional: Enable Private Google Access on the subnet where you plan to deploy the Connector.
+
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Private Google Access^] is recommended if you have a direct connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VPC and you want communication between the Connector and Google Cloud Storage to stay in your virtual private network. Note that Private Google Access works with VM instances that have only internal (private) IP addresses (no external IP addresses).

=== Preparing Google Cloud Storage

When you set up tiering, you need to provide storage access keys for a service account that has Storage Admin permissions. A service account enables Cloud Tiering to authenticate and access Cloud Storage buckets used for data tiering. The keys are required so that Google Cloud Storage knows who is making the request.

The Cloud Storage buckets must be in a link:reference-google-support.html#supported-google-cloud-regions[region that supports Cloud Tiering].

NOTE: If you are planning to configure Cloud Tiering to use lower cost storage classes where your tiered data will transition to after a certain number of days, you must not select any life cycle rules when setting up the bucket in your GCP account. Cloud Tiering manages the life cycle transitions.

.Steps

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role^].

. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^] and create access keys for the service account:

.. Select a project, and click *Interoperability*. If you havenâ€™t already done so, click *Enable interoperability access*.

.. Under *Access keys for service accounts*, click *Create a key for a service account*, select the service account that you just created, and click *Create Key*.
+
You'll need to enter the keys later when you set up Cloud Tiering.

== Tiering inactive data from your first cluster to Google Cloud Storage

After you prepare your Google Cloud environment, start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

.What you'll need
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[An on-premises working environment^].
* Storage access keys for a service account that has the Storage Admin role.

.Steps

. Select an on-prem cluster.

. Click *Enable* for the Tiering service.
//+
//If the Google Cloud Storage tiering destination exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the cluster onto the Google Cloud Storage working environment to initiate the setup wizard.
+
image:screenshot_setup_tiering_onprem.png[A screenshot that shows the Enable option that appears on the right side of the screen after you select an on-prem ONTAP working environment.]

. *Define Object Storage Name*: Enter a name for this object storage. It must be unique from any other object storage you may be using with aggregates on this cluster.

. *Select Provider*: Select *Google Cloud* and click *Continue*.

. Complete the steps on the *Create Object Storage* pages:

.. *Bucket*: Add a new Google Cloud Storage bucket or select an existing bucket.

.. *Storage Class Life Cycle*: Cloud Tiering manages the life cycle transitions of your tiered data. Data starts in the _Standard_ class, but you can create rules to move the data to other classes after a certain number of days.
+
Select the Google Cloud storage class that you want to transition the tiered data to and the number of days before the data will be moved, and click *Continue*. For example, the screenshot below shows that tiered data is moved from the _Standard_ class to the _Nearline_ class after 30 days in object storage, and then to the _Coldline_ class after 60 days in object storage.
+
If you choose *Keep data in this storage class*, then the data remains in the that storage class. link:reference-google-support.html[See supported storage classes^].
+
image:screenshot_tiering_lifecycle_selection_gcp.png[A screenshot showing how to select additional storage classes where data is moved after a certain number of days.]
+
Note that the life cycle rule is applied to all objects in the selected bucket.

.. *Credentials*: Enter the storage access key and secret key for a service account that has the Storage Admin role.

.. *Cluster Network*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.

. Click *Continue* to select the volumes that you want to tier.

. On the _Tier Volumes_ page, select the volumes that you want to configure tiering for and launch the Tiering Policy page:

+
* To select all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]) and click *Configure volumes*.
* To select multiple volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]) and click *Configure volumes*.
* To select a single volume, click the row (or image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[edit pencil icon] icon) for the volume.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_tier_volumes.png[A screenshot that shows how to select a single volume, multiple volumes, or all volumes, and the modify selected volumes button.]

. In the _Tiering Policy_ dialog, select a tiering policy, optionally adjust the cooling days for the selected volumes, and click *Apply*.
