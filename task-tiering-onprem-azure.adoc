== Requirements

Verify support for your ONTAP cluster, set up your networking, and prepare your object storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

Active data resides on the ONTAP cluster, while inactive data resides in object storage."]

NOTE: Communication between the Connector and Blob storage is for object storage setup only. The Connector can reside on your premises, instead of in the cloud.

=== Preparing your ONTAP clusters

Your ONTAP clusters must meet the following requirements when tiering data to Azure Blob storage.

Supported ONTAP platforms::
* When using ONTAP 9.8 and later: You can tier data from AFF systems, or FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates or all-HDD aggregates.
* When using ONTAP 9.7 and earlier: You can tier data from AFF systems, or FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates.

Supported ONTAP version::
ONTAP 9.4 or later

include::_include/tiering-admin-app-access.adoc[]

Cluster networking requirements::
* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over port 443 to Azure Blob storage.
+
ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.
+
Although ExpressRoute provides better performance and lower data transfer charges, it's not required between the ONTAP cluster and Azure Blob storage. But doing so is the recommended best practice.

* An inbound connection is required from the Connector, which can reside in an Azure VNet or on your premises.
+
A connection between the cluster and the Cloud Tiering service is not required.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to tier. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
When you set up data tiering, Cloud Tiering prompts you for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[LIFs^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[IPspaces^].

include::_include/tiering_supported_volumes.adoc[]

NOTE: Cloud Tiering supports FlexGroup volumes, starting with ONTAP 9.5. Setup works the same as any other volume.

=== Discovering an ONTAP cluster

You need to create an on-prem ONTAP working environment in BlueXP before you can start tiering cold data.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster^].

=== Creating or switching Connectors

A Connector is required to tier data to the cloud. When tiering data to Azure Blob storage, you can use a Connector that's in an Azure VNet or in your premises. You'll either need to create a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides in Azure or on-prem.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[Deploying a Connector in Azure^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-on-prem.html[Installing a Connector on a Linux host^]
//* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html[Switching between Connectors^]

=== Verify that you have the necessary Connector permissions

If you created the Connector using BlueXP version 3.9.25 or greater, then you're all set. The custom role that provides the permissions that a Connector needs to manage resources and processes within your Azure network will be set up by default. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html#custom-role-permissions[required custom role permissions^] and the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html#cloud-tiering[specific permissions required for Cloud Tiering^].

If you created the Connector using an earlier version of BlueXP, then you'll need to edit the permission list for the Azure account to add any missing permissions.

=== Preparing networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections. A Connector can be installed on-prem or in Azure.

.Steps

. Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to the Cloud Tiering service and to your Azure Blob object storage (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-set-up-networking-azure.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[see the list of endpoints^])
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF

. If needed, enable a VNet service endpoint to Azure storage.
+
A VNet service endpoint to Azure storage is recommended if you have an ExpressRoute or VPN connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VNet and you want communication between the Connector and Blob storage to stay in your virtual private network.

=== Preparing Azure Blob storage

When you set up tiering, you need to identify the resource group you want to use, and the storage account and Azure container that belong to the resource group. A storage account enables Cloud Tiering to authenticate and access the Blob container used for data tiering.

Cloud Tiering supports tiering to any storage account in any region that can be accessed via the Connector.

Cloud Tiering supports only the General Purpose v2 and Premium Block Blob types of storage accounts.
//
//The Blob container must be in a link:reference-azure-support.html#supported-azure-regions[region that supports Cloud Tiering].

NOTE: If you are planning to configure Cloud Tiering to use a lower cost access tier where your tiered data will transition to after a certain number of days, you must not select any life cycle rules when setting up the container in your Azure account. Cloud Tiering manages the life cycle transitions.

== Tiering inactive data from your first cluster to Azure Blob storage

After you prepare your Azure environment, start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

.What you'll need

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[An on-premises working environment^].

.Steps

. Select the on-prem ONTAP working environment.

. Click *Enable* for the Tiering service from the right panel.
+
If the Azure Blob tiering destination exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the cluster onto the Azure Blob working environment to initiate the setup wizard.
+
image:screenshot_setup_tiering_onprem.png[A screenshot that shows the Enable option that appears on the right side of the screen after you select an on-prem ONTAP working environment.]

. *Define Object Storage Name*: Enter a name for this object storage. It must be unique from any other object storage you may be using with aggregates on this cluster.

. *Select Provider*: Select *Microsoft Azure* and click *Continue*.

. Complete the steps on the *Create Object Storage* pages:

.. *Resource Group*: Select a resource group where an existing container is managed, or where you'd like to create a new container for tiered data, and click *Continue*.
+
When using an on-prem Connector, you must enter the Azure Subscription that provides access to the resource group.

.. *Azure Container*: Select the radio button to either add a new Blob container to a storage account or to use an existing container. Then select the storage account and choose the existing container, or enter the name for the new container. Then click *Continue*.
+
The storage accounts and containers that appear in this step belong to the resource group that you selected in the previous step.

.. *Access Tier Life Cycle*: Cloud Tiering manages the life cycle transitions of your tiered data. Data starts in the _Hot_ class, but you can create a rule to move the data to the _Cool_ class after a certain number of days.
+
Select the access tier that you want to transition the tiered data to and the number of days before the data will be moved, and click *Continue*. For example, the screenshot below shows that tiered data is moved from the _Hot_ class to the _Cool_ class after 45 days in object storage.
+
If you choose *Keep data in this access tier*, then the data remains in the _Hot_ access tier and no rules are applied. link:reference-azure-support.html[See supported access tiers^].
+
image:screenshot_tiering_lifecycle_selection_azure.png[A screenshot showing how to select another access tier where data is moved after a certain number of days.]
+
Note that the life cycle rule is applied to all blob containers in the selected storage account.

.. *Cluster Network*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage, and click *Continue*.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.

. On the _Tier Volumes_ page, select the volumes that you want to configure tiering for and launch the Tiering Policy page:

+
* To select all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[""]) and click *Configure volumes*.
* To select multiple volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[""]) and click *Configure volumes*.
* To select a single volume, click the row (or image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[edit pencil icon] icon) for the volume.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_tier_volumes.png[A screenshot that shows how to select a single volume, multiple volumes, or all volumes, and the modify selected volumes button.]

. In the _Tiering Policy_ dialog, select a tiering policy, optionally adjust the cooling days for the selected volumes, and click *Apply*.
+
link:concept-cloud-tiering.html#volume-tiering-policies[Learn more about volume tiering policies and cooling days].
+
image:screenshot_tiering_policy_settings.png[A screenshot that shows the configurable tiering policy settings.]

.Result

You've successfully set up data tiering from volumes on the cluster to Azure Blob object storage.
