BlueXP tiering supports several S3 storage classes and most regions.

== Supported S3 storage classes

When you set up data tiering to AWS, BlueXP tiering automatically uses the _Standard_ storage class for your inactive data. BlueXP tiering can apply a lifecycle rule so the data transitions from the _Standard_ storage class to another storage class after a certain number of days. You can choose from the following storage classes:

* Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
* One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
* Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
* Glacier Instant Retrieval

If you do not choose another storage class, then the data remains in the _Standard_ storage class and no rules are applied.

When you configure a BlueXP tiering lifecycle rule, you must not configure any lifecycle rules when setting up the bucket in your AWS account.
