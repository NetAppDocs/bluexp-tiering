After you've configured your on-prem ONTAP clusters to tier data to a particular object storage, you can perform additional object storage tasks. You can add new object storage, mirror your tiered data to a secondary object storage, swap the primary and mirror object storage, delete object storage, and more.

== Viewing object stores configured for a cluster

You might want to see all the object stores that have been configured for your cluster and to which aggregates they are attached. Cloud Tiering provides this information for each cluster.

.Steps

. From the *Clusters Dashboard*, click the menu icon for a cluster and select *Cluster info*.

. Review details about the object store.
+
This example shows both an Amazon S3 and Azure Blob object store attached to different aggregates on a cluster.
+

If you want to add a new object store for this cluster you can click *Create New Object Store* to start the wizard.

== Adding a new object store

You can add a new object store that will be available for aggregates in your cluster. After you create it, you can attach it to an aggregate.

.Steps

. From the *Clusters Dashboard*, click the menu icon for a cluster and select *Cluster info*.

. From the Object Store Information page, click *Create New Object Store*.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_object_store_create_button.png["A screenshot showing the Create New Object Store button to create a new object store."]
+
The object store wizard starts. The example below shows how to create an object store in Amazon S3.

. *Define Object Storage Name*: Enter a name for this object storage. It must be unique from any other object storage you may be using with aggregates on this cluster.

. *Select Provider*: Select *Amazon Web Services* and click *Continue*.

. Complete the steps on the *Create Object Storage* pages:

.. *S3 Bucket*: Add a new S3 bucket or select an existing S3 bucket that starts with the prefix _fabric-pool_, select the bucket region, and click *Continue*.
+
When using an on-prem Connector, you must enter the AWS Account ID that provides access to the existing S3 bucket or new S3 bucket that will be created.
+
The _fabric-pool_ prefix is required because the IAM policy for the Connector enables the instance to perform S3 actions on buckets named with that exact prefix. For example, you could name the S3 bucket _fabric-pool-AFF1_, where AFF1 is the name of the cluster.

.. *Storage Class Life Cycle*: Cloud Tiering manages the life cycle transitions of your tiered data. Data starts in the _Standard_ class, but you can create a rule to move the data to another class after a certain number of days.
+
Select the S3 storage class that you want to transition the tiered data to and the number of days before the data will be moved, and click *Continue*. For example, the screenshot below shows that tiered data is moved from the _Standard_ class to the _Standard-IA_ class after 45 days in object storage.
+
If you choose *Keep data in this storage class*, then the data remains in the _Standard_ storage class and no rules are applied. link:reference-aws-support.html[See supported storage classes^].
+
image:screenshot_tiering_lifecycle_selection_aws.png[A screenshot showing how to select another storage class where data is moved after a certain number of days.]
+
Note that the life cycle rule is applied to all objects in the selected bucket.

.. *Credentials*: Enter the access key ID and secret key for an IAM user who has the required S3 permissions, and click *Continue*.
+
The IAM user must be in the same AWS account as the bucket that you selected or created on the *S3 Bucket* page.

.. *Cluster Network*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage, and click *Continue*.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.

The object store is created.

Now you can attach the object store to an aggregate in your cluster.

== Attaching a second object store to an aggregate for mirroring

You can attach a second object store to an aggregate to create a FabricPool mirror to replicate an object store. You must have one object store already attached to the aggregate.

.Steps

. From the *Clusters Dashboard*, click *Advanced Setup* for the selected cluster.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_advanced_setup_button.png[A screenshot showing the Advanced Setup button for a cluster.]

. From the Advanced Setup page, drag the object store you want to use to the location for the mirror object store.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_mirror_config.png["A screenshot showing how to drag a second object store to an aggregate to create a tiering mirror."]

. In the Attach Object Store dialog, click *Attach* and the second object store is attached to the aggregate.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_mirror_config_complete.png["A screenshot showing a second object store attached to an aggregate."]

== Swapping the primary and mirror object store

You can swap the primary and mirror object store for an aggregate. The object store mirror becomes the primary, and the original primary becomes the mirror.

.Steps

. From the *Clusters Dashboard*, click *Advanced Setup* for the selected cluster.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_advanced_setup_button.png[A screenshot showing the Advanced Setup button for a cluster.]

. From the Advanced Setup page, click the menu icon for the aggregate and select *Swap Destinations*.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_mirror_swap.png["A screenshot showing the Swap Destination option for an aggregate."]

The primary and mirror objects stores are swapped.

== Removing a mirror object store from an aggregate

You can remove a FabricPool mirror if you no longer need to replicate an object store.

.Steps

. From the *Clusters Dashboard*, click *Advanced Setup* for the selected cluster.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_advanced_setup_button.png[A screenshot showing the Advanced Setup button for a cluster.]

. From the Advanced Setup page, click the menu icon for the aggregate and select *Delete Tiering Mirror*.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_mirror_delete.png["A screenshot showing the Delete Tiering Mirror option for an aggregate."]

The mirror object store is removed from the aggregate and the tiered data is no longer replicated.
