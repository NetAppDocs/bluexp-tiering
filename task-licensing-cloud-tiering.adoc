A 30-day free trial of Cloud Tiering starts when you set up tiering from your first cluster. After the free trial ends, you’ll need to pay for Cloud Tiering through a pay-as-you-go Cloud Manager subscription from your cloud provider’s marketplace, a BYOL license from NetApp, or a combination of both.

A few notes before you read any further:

* If you've already subscribed to the Cloud Manager subscription (PAYGO) in your cloud provider's marketplace, then you're automatically subscribed to Cloud Tiering from on-premises ONTAP systems as well. You’ll see an active subscription in the Cloud Tiering *Licensing* tab. You won’t need to subscribe again.
// You'll see an active subscription in the Digital Wallet.

* The BYOL Cloud Tiering license is a _floating_ license that you can use across multiple on-premises ONTAP clusters in your Cloud Manager account. This is different than in the past where you purchased a _FabricPool_ license for each cluster.

* There are no charges when tiering data to StorageGRID, so neither a BYOL license or PAYGO registration is required. This tiered data doesn’t count against the capacity purchased in your license.

== Use a Cloud Tiering BYOL license

Bring-your-own licenses from NetApp provide 2-, 12-, 24-, or 36-month terms. The BYOL *Cloud Tiering* license is a _floating_ license that you can use across multiple on-premises ONTAP clusters in your Cloud Manager account. The total tiering capacity defined in your Cloud Tiering license is shared among *all* of your on-prem clusters, making initial licensing and renewal easy.

If you don't have a Cloud Tiering license, contact us to purchase one:

* mailto:ng-cloud-tiering@netapp.com?subject=Licensing[Send email to purchase a license].
* Click the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager to request a license.

Optionally, if you have an unassigned node-based license for Cloud Volumes ONTAP that you won't be using, you can convert it to a Cloud Tiering license with the same dollar-equivalence and the same expiration date. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-managing-licenses.html#exchange-unassigned-node-based-licenses[Go here for details^].

You use the Digital Wallet page in Cloud Manager to manage Cloud Tiering BYOL licenses. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

=== New Cloud Tiering BYOL licensing starting August 21, 2021

The new *Cloud Tiering* license was introduced in August 2021 for tiering configurations that are supported within Cloud Manager using the Cloud Tiering service. Cloud Manager currently supports tiering to the following cloud storage: Amazon S3, Azure Blob storage, Google Cloud Storage, S3-compatible object storage, and StorageGRID.

The *FabricPool* license that you may have used in the past to tier on-premises ONTAP data to the cloud is being retained only for ONTAP deployments in sites that have no internet access (also known as "dark sites"). If you have a dark site deployment, you'll install a FabricPool license on each cluster using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

TIP: Note that tiering to StorageGRID does not require a FabricPool or Cloud Tiering license.

If you are currently using FabricPool licensing, you're not affected until your FabricPool license reaches its expiration date or maximum capacity. Contact NetApp when you need to update your license, or earlier to make sure there is no interruption in your ability to tier data to the cloud.

* If you're using a configuration that's supported in Cloud Manager, your FabricPool licenses will be converted to Cloud Tiering licenses and they'll appear in the Digital Wallet. When those initial licenses expire, you'll need to update the Cloud Tiering licenses.
* If you're using a configuration that's not supported in Cloud Manager, then you'll continue using a FabricPool license. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/cloud-install-fabricpool-task.html[See how to license tiering using System Manager^].

Here are some things you need to know about the two licenses:
