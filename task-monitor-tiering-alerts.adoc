You can view the status of tiering alerts in the BlueXP Notification Center.

At this time, there is one tiering event that will appear as a notification:

* Tier additional data from cluster <name> to object storage to increase your storage efficiency

This notification is a "Recommendation" to help make your systems more efficient and to save on storage costs. It indicates that a cluster is tiering less than 20% of its cold data - including clusters that are tiering no data. It provides a link to the https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering-service-tco[BlueXP tiering total cost of ownership and savings calculator^] to help you calculate your cost savings.

All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails. Emails can be sent to any BlueXP users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of ransomware protection incidents.
