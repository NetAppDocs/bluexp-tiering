You can view the status of tiering alerts in the BlueXP Notification Center. 

The Notification Center tracks the progress of tiering incidents so you can verify whether they have been resolved or not. You can display the notifications by clicking the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the BlueXP menu bar. 

At this time, there is one tiering event that will appear as a notification:

Tier additional data from cluster <name> to object storage to increase your storage efficiency

This notification is a "Recommendation" to help make your systems more efficient and to save on storage costs. It indicates that a cluster is tiering less than 20% of its cold data - including clusters that are tiering no data. It provides a link to the https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering-service-tco[BlueXP tiering total cost of ownership and savings calculator^] to help you calculate your cost savings.

BlueXP does not send an email for this notification.
