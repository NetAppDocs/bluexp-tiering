Cloud Tiering supports several Google Cloud storage classes and most regions.

== Supported GCP storage classes

When you set up data tiering to GCP, Cloud Tiering automatically uses the _Standard_ storage class for your inactive data. Cloud Tiering can apply a lifecycle rule so the data transitions from the _Standard_ storage class to other storage classes after a certain number of days. You can choose from the following storage classes:

* Nearline
* Coldline
* Archive

If you do not choose another storage class, then the data remains in the _Standard_ storage class and no rules are applied.

When you configure a Cloud Tiering lifecycle rule, you must not configure any lifecycle rules when setting up the bucket in your Google account.
